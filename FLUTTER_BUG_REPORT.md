## Detailed Bug Reports

### FB-001: Critical Memory Leak in AddTransactionPage
**Severity:** Critical  
**Priority:** P0 - Must Fix  
**Component:** `/home/k/working/Squin/budget/lib/pages/addTransactionPage.dart`

**Description:**
The AddTransactionPage class contains incomplete resource cleanup in its dispose() method. While it properly disposes of the `enterTitleFocus` FocusNode, it fails to clean up other resources that may be allocated during the widget's lifecycle, particularly those related to async operations and potential timers.

**Technical Details:**
- Class: `_AddTransactionPageState` (lines 134-135)
- Current dispose() implementation: lines 2494-2497
- Missing cleanup for 62+ async operations
- No cleanup for potential image picker resources
- No cleanup for potential timer resources

**Root Cause:**
Incomplete implementation of the dispose() method pattern in a StatefulWidget with complex lifecycle management.

**User Impact:**
- Memory leaks leading to app performance degradation
- Potential crashes during rapid navigation
- Battery drain from unreleased resources
- Poor user experience during extended app usage

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to AddTransactionPage
2. Initiate transaction creation with image attachments
3. Navigate away before completion
4. Repeat 10-15 times
5. Observe memory usage increase

**Expected Behavior:**
All allocated resources should be properly disposed of when the widget is removed from the widget tree.

**Actual Behavior:**
Some resources remain allocated after widget disposal, leading to memory accumulation.

**Remediation Code:**
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  // Dispose existing resources
  enterTitleFocus.dispose();
  
  // Add cleanup for additional resources
  _imagePickerSubscription?.cancel();
  _transactionTimer?.cancel();
  _asyncOperationCompleter?.complete();
  
  super.dispose();
}
```

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Unit tests for dispose() method completeness
2. Memory leak detection during navigation stress tests
3. Integration tests for resource cleanup validation

### FB-002: Unsafe setState Operations Without Mounted Checks
**Severity:** High  
**Priority:** P1 - Critical Fix  
**Component:** `/home/k/working/Squin/budget/lib/pages/addTransactionPage.dart`

**Description:**
The AddTransactionPage contains 47 setState() calls without proper mounted checks. This can lead to setState() being called on disposed widgets, causing runtime exceptions and app crashes.

**Technical Details:**
- Total setState calls: 47
- Unprotected setState calls: 47
- Examples at lines: 176, 183, 198, 206, 228, 254, 294, 302, 317, 324
- Pattern: Direct setState() calls in async callbacks

**Root Cause:**
Async operations completing after widget disposal attempt to update state on non-existent widgets.

**User Impact:**
- App crashes with "setState() called after dispose()" errors
- Unpredictable app behavior
- Poor user experience during rapid interactions
- Potential data loss during transaction creation

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open AddTransactionPage
2. Start filling transaction details
3. Quickly navigate away before async operations complete
4. Observe crash logs for setState errors

**Expected Behavior:**
setState() should only be called on mounted widgets.

**Actual Behavior:**
setState() is called regardless of widget mount status, causing exceptions.

**Remediation Code Pattern:**
```dart
// Before (Line 176)
setState(() {
  // state update
});

// After
if (mounted) {
  setState(() {
    // state update
  });
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- High crash rate in production
- Negative user reviews
- Increased support tickets
- Potential data integrity issues

### FB-003: Async Operations Without Widget Lifecycle Validation
**Severity:** High  
**Priority:** P1 - Critical Fix  
**Component:** `/home/k/working/Squin/budget/lib/pages/addTransactionPage.dart`

**Description:**
The page contains 62+ async operations without proper widget lifecycle validation, leading to potential race conditions and resource leaks.

**Technical Details:**
- Total async operations: 62+
- Key methods: `addTransaction()`, `addTransactionLocked()`, `createTransaction()`
- Missing lifecycle checks in async callbacks
- No cancellation mechanisms for long-running operations

**Root Cause:**
Async operations continue executing after widget disposal, attempting to access disposed resources.

**User Impact:**
- Resource leaks from uncompleted operations
- Potential crashes from accessing disposed resources
- Inconsistent app behavior
- Performance degradation over time

**Remediation Strategy:**
1. Add mounted checks before all async operations
2. Implement cancellation tokens for long-running operations
3. Use try-catch blocks with proper resource cleanup

### FB-004: AccountAndBackup Widget State Management Issues
**Severity:** Medium  
**Priority:** P2 - Important Fix  
**Component:** `/home/k/working/Squin/budget/lib/widgets/accountAndBackup.dart`

**Description:**
The AccountAndBackup widget contains 8 setState calls without mounted checks, following the same pattern as other components.

**Technical Details:**
- Total setState calls: 8
- All lack mounted checks
- Similar pattern to AddTransactionPage

**Remediation Required:**
Apply the same mounted check pattern as implemented in SettingsPage.

  final state = tester.state<_AddTransactionPageState>(find.byType(AddTransactionPage));
  
  // Verify resources are allocated
  expect(state.enterTitleFocus, isNotNull);
  
  // Dispose widget
  await tester.pumpWidget(Container());
  
  // Verify resources are cleaned up
  // Add specific assertions for resource cleanup
});
```

### Integration Testing
```dart
// Test mounted checks during navigation
testWidgets('setState calls are safe during navigation', (tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(TestApp());
  
  // Navigate to AddTransactionPage
  await tester.tap(find.text('Add Transaction'));
  await tester.pump();
  
  // Start async operation
  await tester.tap(find.text('Save'));
  
  // Navigate away quickly
  await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.arrow_back));
  await tester.pump();
  
  // Verify no exceptions thrown
  expect(tester.takeException(), isNull);
});
```

### Memory Leak Testing
```dart
// Test for memory leaks during repeated navigation
testWidgets('No memory leaks during repeated navigation', (tester) async {
  for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    await tester.pumpWidget(AddTransactionPage());
    await tester.pump();
    await tester.pumpWidget(Container());
    await tester.pump();
  }
  
  // Verify memory usage hasn't increased significantly
  // Implementation depends on memory profiling tools
